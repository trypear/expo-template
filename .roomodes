      "customInstructions": "When editing the db, you must use the 'createTable' (auto gens prefixed id, createdAt and updatedAt) and 'fk' (which is used to help with typesafe id comparisons + id prefixing for foreign keys, defined under db/utils).\nPrefixed IDs are setup to add the prefix on the APPLICATION LEVEL VIA DRIZZLE. They are NOT required to be included, however you WILL need to do \\`table.id.mapFromDriver(value)\\` when using the sql\\`\\` tag.\nAvoid using the SQL tag wherever possible, and DO NOT FORGET TO MAP THE UUID WHEN YOU USE RAW SQL.\nWhen you are generating SQL for migrations, you MUST NOT INCLUDE THIS PREFIX!\n\nTo create test data, run \\`pnpm --filter @acme/db generate\\` to generate the sql from the drizzle schema, then edit /packages/database/drizzle/{file}.sql, you MUST run this generate command for drizzle to be happy.\n\nDo NOT include mock data ANYWHERE else, ONLY PUT THE MOCK DATA IN THE DATABASE AND MAKE SURE YOU GIVE THE DATABASE UNPREFIXED UUIDs WHEN GENERATING MOCK DATA.\nTo push the SQL to the database, run: \\`pnpm --filter @acme/db migrate\\` \n\nFor database migrations in development:\n1. Generate migrations: pnpm --filter @acme/db generate\n2. Review the SQL in drizzle/*.sql files\n3. Apply migrations: pnpm --filter @acme/db migrate\n4. If tables already exist, consider dropping them or using a fresh database\n\nTO GENERATE MOCK DATA:\n1. Run \\`pnpm --filter @acme/db generate --custom --name=\"mock-data\"\\`\n2. Edit the packages/db/drizzle/XXXX_mock-data.sql file\n3. Rely on the autogenerated IDs where possible, otherwise MAKE SURE YOU GENREATE UUIDs\n4. Run \\`pnpm --filter @acme/db migrate\\`\n\nYOU ONlY DO DATABASE RELATED OPERATIONS UNDER THE `packages/db` FOLDER.\nTHE SCHEMA IS LOCATED AT: `pacakges/db/schema.ts` AND YOU CAN CREATE ZOD SCHEMAS FOR COMMON OPERATIONS UNDER `packages/db/zod-schema.ts`.\n\nONLY USE THE THE --custom FLAG WHEN YOU WANT AN EMPTY MIGRATION TO PUT IN TEST DATA, WITHOUT THIS FLAG, DRIZZLE WILL AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE THE SQL AS DEFINED IN schema.ts. YOU MUST GENERATE WITHOUT THE CUSTOM FLAG BEFORE YOU GENERATE A CUSTOM MIGRATION! \nIf you get `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'drizzle/meta/_journal.json'` you need to `rm -rf packages/db/drizzle`. Make sure you generate the normal SQL schema migrations to form the tables in the database BEFORE making a --custom migration. Rely on the autogenerated fields where possible. The drizzle schema is camelCase but the SQL is all in snake_case. When you are happy, run `cd packages/db && npx tsc` to check your work. User, Session and Account are ALL NEEDED for NextAUTH, DO NOT TOUCH THEM UNLESS YOU ARE ADDING FIELDS, YOU NEED THEM.

Always start off by reading: packages/db/src/{schema,relations}.ts so you know what you're working with.\n\nDrizzle syntax works like SQL, but you need to use the drizzle functions, for example x >= y is gte(x, y) and x IS NOT NULL in drizzle is isNotNull(x). You have and(x,y,z) and or(x,y,z) functions instead of and/or chaining like in sql.  When you are happy, run `cd packages/api && npx tsc` to check your work.",
