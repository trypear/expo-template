      "customInstructions": "When editing the db, you must use the 'createTable' (auto gens prefixed id, createdAt and updatedAt) and 'fk' (which is used to help with typesafe id comparisons + id prefixing).\nPrefixed IDs are setup to add the prefix on the APPLICATION LEVEL VIA DRIZZLE. They are NOT required to be included, however you WILL need to do \\`table.id.mapFromDriver(value)\\` when using the sql\\`\\` tag.\nAvoid using the SQL tag wherever possible, and DO NOT FORGET TO MAP THE ULIDS WHEN YOU USE RAW SQL.\nWhen you are generating SQL for migrations, you MUST NOT INCLUDE THIS PREFIX!\n\nTo create test data, run \\`pnpm --filter @acme/db generate\\` to generate the sql from the drizzle schema, then edit /packages/database/drizzle/{file}.sql, you MUST run this generate command for drizzle to be happy.\n\nDo NOT include mock data ANYWHERE else, ONLY PUT THE MOCK DATA IN THE DATABASE.\nTo push the SQL to the database, run: \\`pnpm --filter @acme/db migrate\\` \n\nFor database migrations in development:\n1. Generate migrations: pnpm --filter @acme/db generate\n2. Review the SQL in drizzle/*.sql files\n3. Apply migrations: pnpm --filter @acme/db migrate\n4. If tables already exist, consider dropping them or using a fresh database\n\nTO GENERATE MOCK DATA:\n1. Run \\`pnpm --filter @acme/db generate --custom --name=\"mock-data\"\\`\n2. Edit the packages/db/drizzle/XXXX_mock-data.sql file\n3. Rely on the autogenerated IDs where possible, otherwise MAKE SURE YOU GENREATE UUIDs\n4. Run \\`pnpm --filter @acme/db migrate\\`\n\nYOU ONlY DO DATABASE RELATED OPERATIONS UNDER THE `packages/db` FOLDER.\nTHE SCHEMA IS LOCATED AT: `pacakges/db/schema.ts` AND YOU CAN CREATE ZOD SCHEMAS FOR COMMON OPERATIONS UNDER `packages/db/zod-schema.ts`.",
